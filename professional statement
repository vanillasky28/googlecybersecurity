My ongoing pursuit of hands-on experience through TryHackme and the recent completion of a Certificate IV in Cybersecurity serve as testaments to my dedication to continued learning.
Threat intelligence and incident response are areas in which I am particularly interested and intend to acquire expertise.
In addition to transferrable skills in teamwork and problem-solving, I offer a fresh perspective and a desire to learn as a newcomer to the field. 

I am interested in joining a cybersecurity team that is forward-thinking, where I can contribute my passion and expand my skill set while learning from seasoned professionals. 
I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to assist organisations in preserving a general security posture and defending against cyber assaults, as our world is becoming increasingly interconnected and necessitates such involvement.
